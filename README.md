when we  give credentials into login page by clickon  the login button,  also at  down we have lots of buttons for different pages.for that we create login.java,to get the details and for  login web page,  we create login.html
Here, in this project we create class, student, subject and teacher  java classes in model package for getting  their corresponding details
later to open web page we create  HTML pages  which are mapping with class, student, subject and teacher interlinkely, also for update the student details and web page. we took UdpateStudent class and Update-Student.html  file.
so, we can add the students,  and their corresponding details of them  also delete the details and students from the list.
